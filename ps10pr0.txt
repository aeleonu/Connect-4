Suppose that pivot searching were readily available to you.
To what extent could you imagine using it?
Do you feel it would make you more productive â€“
or would this type of search remain largely unused
in the way you interact with computation and electronic materials?


I think that I would use it frequently the first few times and then I would
sort of use it less frequently as time goes on. However, I think it would be very
benefitial in case I needed to figure out a website name that I was looking for.
I think it would be productive for the most part, but at the same time, I'm
not sure I would use it on a regular basis.
